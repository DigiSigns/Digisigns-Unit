# DIGISIGNS UNIT CODE

* This serves as the main codebase for everything Digisigns does to download, process, and play videos. Currently, we are in the prototype phase of development. As such, we are relying on third-party libraries (libvlc, ffmpeg, etc.) to handle most of the heavy lifting.
* At some point in the future, we had planned to migrate the entire project to C++ (i.e., removing reliance on Python and Go), although this really does not need to be done.
